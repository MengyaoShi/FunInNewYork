# FunInNewYork
Go to my website https://mengyaoshi.github.io/FunInNewYork/FunInNewYork.html

This work is built by using R markdown and leaflet package. You can see an interactive map of New York City with some attractions I would like to go to. Around each
attraction, a real time map where citibikes are available is marked with blue pin. You can also click on links of each attraction which will guide you to their official website
for tickets and open hour information. Enjoy!
